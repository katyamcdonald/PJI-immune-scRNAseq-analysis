# PJI-immune-scRNAseq-analysis
This repository contains code used to analyze single-cell RNA-seq data from mouse and human periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) tissue. Analyses use publicly available datasets (GEO: GSE269658, GSE241739) and include quality control, integration, annotation, and figure generation. Figures were generated for the paper "Immune Checkpoint Molecules as Biomarkers of Staphylococcus aureus Bone Infection and Clinical Outcome".
